# Multi Gitter Scripts

A collection of scripts to use with [multi-gitter](https://github.com/lindell/multi-gitter).

Performing a multi-repository change is a two-step process:

1. Create the PRs in all repositories
2. Merge them

These steps require you to run two different `multi-gitter` commands. For more details, see their documentation.
